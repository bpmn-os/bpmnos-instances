# OR-Library

## [J E Beasley](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/jeb.html)

OR-Library is a collection of test data sets for a variety of OR problems.

A full list of the test data sets available in OR-Library can be found [here](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/info.html).

## Assignment problem

There are currently 12 data files.

These data files are taken from J.E.Beasley
"Linear programming on Cray supercomputers" Journal
of the Operational Research Society 41 (1990) 133-139.

Eight problems are from Table 2 of that paper.

The following table gives the relationship between test
problem set in Table 2 and the appropriate files:

| Problem set |       Files |
|---|---|
| 100 |                assign100 |
| 200 |                assign200 |
| 300 |                assign300 |
| 400 |                assign400 |
| 500 |                assign500 |
| 600 |                assign600 |
| 700 |                assign700 |
| 800 |                assign800 |

The format of these data files is:
```
number of items to be assigned (n)
for each item i (i=1,...,n):
the cost of allocating item i to item j (c(i,j),j=1,...,n)
```

Four problems are from Table 3 of that paper.

The following table gives the relationship between test
problem set in Table 3 and the appropriate files:

| Problem set |       Files |
|---|---|
| 800 |                assignp800 |
| 1500 |               assignp1500 |
| 3000 |               assignp3000 |
| 5000 |               assignp5000 |

The format of these data files is:
```
number of items to be assigned (n)
for each valid assignment:
i, j, c(i,j) the cost of allocating item i to item j
```

The value of the optimal solution for each of these data
files is given in the file `assignopt`.

The largest file is `assign800` of size 2000Kb (approximately).
The entire set of files is of size 12000Kb (approximately).
