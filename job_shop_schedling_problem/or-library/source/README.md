## Job shop scheduling

There are currently two data files.

The first data file is `jobshop1`
This data file contains 82 test instances commonly cited in the
literature. The format of these test instances is described within
the file.

The second data file is `jobshop2`
This data file contains PASCAL and C code for generating
job shop scheduling instances. These instances are
given in "Benchmarks for basic scheduling problems" by
E. Taillard, European Journal of Operational Research 64, (1993),
278-285.

Furthermore, all flow shop instances can be used as test instances
for the job shop scheduling problem; see the file `flowshopinfo`.

The first file is of size 128Kb (approximately);
the second file is of size 17Kb (approximately).
